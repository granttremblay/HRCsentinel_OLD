Implications
HRC-01  HV     X  MCP HV Ramped Down in RADZONE  HRC-R-002  Damage to MCPs from operation at high rates
  HRC-02  HV     X  Antico Shield HV off in RADZONE     Damage to PMT from operation at high rates
  HRC-03  HV     X  HRC-S MCP HV Ramping SCSs disabled when HRC-I selected  HRC-C-006   
  HRC-04  HV     X  HRC-I MCP HV Ramping SCSs disabled when HRC-S selected  HRC-C-006   
  HRC-05  HV     X  MCP HV Ramp-up SCSs not enabled if RADMON disabled  HRC-R-002  No RADMON protection of MCP in
operation
  DELETED
HRC-06  MECH     X  HRC door "close" safing SCS not disabled while door "open"     Loss of protection from door in the
case of a safing action
  HRC-07  MECH     X  HRC door "close" safing SCS not enabled while door "closed"     Over-close the HRC door during a
safing action
 require ground intervention to correct
  HRC-08  MECH     X  HRC door "open" for observation     No science data
  HRC-09  OBS     X  HRC configuration correct for observation     Poor quality science data
  HRC-10  OBS     X  TLM format 1 for HRC observations     Loss of science data
  HRC-11  OBS     X  SIM translation correct for observation     Poor quality or no science data
  HRC-12  OBS     X  SIM focus correct for observation     Poor quality science data
  HRC-13  OBS     X  Correct dither selected for HRC observations  HRC-R-004  Possible localized damage to MCP
  HRC-14  HV  X  X  MCP HV turn-on only via SCSs 92 and 93  HRC-C-006   
  HRC-15  MECH     X  Shutters HOME prior to HRC door motion  HRC-C-001  Door and shutter collide - loss of instrument
  HRC-16  MECH     X  HRC Door not moved to OPEN limit     Snubbers break off
  HRC-17  MECH     X  HRC Door not moved to CLOSED limit  HRC-L-001  Over-stress door mechanism - potential loss of
instrument
  DELETED
HRC-18  RADZONE     X  HRC Door "closed" in RADZONE     Possible degradation of UV/ion shields
  HRC-19  RADZONE     X  SIM translated to HRC-S for RADZONE     Loss of ACIS safing
  HRC-20  CMD  X  X  Time between HRC commands > 1 second     Command collisions
  HRC-21  CMD  X  X  HRC telemetry timing commanded at format changes  HRC-L-003  Loss of science data
  HRC-22  OBS     X  HRC Dither Control SCS not disabled     Loss of science data
  HRC-23  OBS     X  MCP HV turn-on SCSs not disabled     Loss of science data
  HRC-24  HV     X  HRC HV safing SCS (# 104) not disabled     Loss of SI safing capability
  HRC-25  RADZONE     X  RADMON disabled in RADZONE     Unintended SI safing
  HRC-26  HV     X  Detectors not switched with MCP HV on  HRC-C-005  Possible damage to charge amplifiers
  HRC-27  MECH     X  Shutters moved with HRC door not "open"  HRC-C-008  Door and shutter collide - loss of instrument
  HRC-28  HV     X  MCP HV turn-on only for selected detector  HRC-C-006  Possible MCP damage
  HRC-29  MECH     X  Any mechanism selected for commanding     Protect against a second relay failure
  HRC-30  HV     X  PMT HV step increase size not greater-than 4     Possible PMT HV damage
  HRC-31  OBS     X  Exposure time at least 90% of requested     Less than approved science data
  HRC-32  SAFE     X  PMT HV at operational level for science observing time
 (while RADMON is enabled)     Full RADMON protection of SIs
  HRC-33  HV  X     No HRC MCP or PMT HV commands in vehicle loads     Possible MCP or PMT damage
  HRC-34  HV  X     No HRC HV SCS enable or active commands in vehicle loads     Possible MCP damage
